Project 1
First, we downloaded the Excel file from here:
https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/global-shark-attack/table/?disjunctive.country&disjunctive.area&disjunctive.activity

Then we manually removed lines in Excel for Types that were seemingly not valid: Invalid, Unconfirmed, Unverified, Under Investigation, ?, (Blanks)

Finally, we each downloaded the file and got to work on our analysis.
